"One of the tasks I was given to do when I was interviewing for a job was to build an app for an Olympic sporting event using only html, css, and js. I was given specific dimensions, colors and images that I had to use in the app. 

The app was to take the scores given by 9 countries and place them in boxes next to pictures of each country's flag. 

The app would then identify the lowest score out of the 9 countries and highlight that box red. 

Then, the app will identify the highest score out of the 9 countries and highlight that box green. 

The scores could only be between 0 and 10. 

The scores would then be added up and averaged out and the result would be shown in a different box. 

We could go for bonus points if we built an entire scoreboard with the names of athletes, their scores, and who was in first, second, and third places according to their scores."
